Combat chart:

	Check types of both sides, send them to the checking function. Checking function works on a switch statement, looping as many times as there are typings -1 (Because 2T & 1T only needs two checks, not three and 1T & 1T only needs a single check instead of two.) It will use a local variable to store how powerful the left pokemon is to the right pokemon. After comparing all 2-4 types against each of the other pokemons types the total 'estimated strength' will be sent back to be displayed. If strength > 1 display "This match appears to be in your favor, your types make you X times stronger." else if strength == 1 display "This match will be up to skill. The estimated power is equal." else if strength < 1 display "This match is not in your favor, your types make you X as effective."
