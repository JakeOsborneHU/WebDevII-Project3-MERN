# WebDevII-Project3-MERN

## Summary
Create a MERN app that uses the RESTful web API created from the second project. The web API will be enhanced to support user authentication.
The app must do something useful with your web API. Ex: A Pokémon app could allow Pokémon that are retrieved from the web API to fight each other. Or the app could allow the user to create new Pokémon or alter existing Pokémon and allow the user to upload an image for the Pokémon.

## Requirements
1. The app should use a web API that was created previously that supports all CRUD operations. The web API can be modified if necessary. The web API should run on the local machine on port 8000 and support CORS. 
2. The app should allow a user to authenticate with a username and password. All accesses to the web API should require the client to send a valid JWT.
3. The project should support an "npm run init" command to load the web API's database with initial data. The database should be initialized with at least one default user: username "bsmith" and password "opensesame".
4. The app should be created by create-react-app and run on port 3000.
5. The app should work as a single-page app using React Router to handle app navigation.
6. The app should use React-Bootstrap (Links to an external site.) or Material-UI  (Links to an external site.)to enhance the visual appeal of the app. No modification of the original styling is necessary.
